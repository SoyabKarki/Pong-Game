# PONG

An interactive replica of the famous Pong game made using Python's Turtle GUI. The code makes use of several user-defined classes, and the time module to increase the pong ball's speed with every hit on the paddle. 

# How to play

Use the arrow keys to control the right paddle and WASD keys to control the left paddle.
Every time the ball hits the paddle, the ball's speed increases a little.
Missing the ball will add a point to the opponent's score.
A score of 10 will result in a win.
Click anywhere on the GUI to exit after the game is over.
